# tangled-adjudicate
Tangled is a game designed such that determining who wins is a problem where there is a claim of quantum supremacy. You
can read all about it [here](https://www.snowdropquantum.com/blog/play-the-game-8e7fb).

This repo contains what I call **_adjudicators_**, which are functions that take as input a Tangled game state and 
output the [influence vector](https://www.snowdropquantum.com/blog/influence) for that game state. In the case when 
the game state is a terminal state, adjudicators also return the outcome of the game (win/loss/draw).

We provide three different adjudicators:

1. A Schr√∂dinger Equation solver, which is only useful for tiny game graphs
2. A Simulated Annealing solver, whose parameters are chosen to mimic D-Wave hardware, and 
3. A Quantum Annealing solver that uses D-Wave hardware

In addition to the basic adjudicators, we provide several utility functions that support the adjudication process.
This allows the tangled-adjudicate repo to support investigation more general than only adjudicating Tangled games.

In particular for the Quantum Annealing solver, there are several non-obvious steps that we document here.

## Tangled Game Graph Specification

A Tangled game graph is specified by a graph number, which label specific graphs included here. In this module there
are 10 included graphs numbered 1 through 10. Each graph requires specification of vertex count (how many vertices 
the graph has) and an explicit edge list, which are included for these ten graphs. If you'd like to add a new graph,
it's simple! Just add it to the GraphProperties class, found in the /utils/game_graph_properties.py file.

## Tangled Game State Specification: Expected Input Format For Adjudicators

The expected input to the adjudicators in this repo are Tangled game states. These are dictionaries with 
the following keys:

* 'num_nodes': an integer, the number of vertices in the game graph
* 'edges': a list of 3-tuples of length edge_count where the first two elements are indices of the vertices that edge connects and the third element is: 0 if the edge is unselected; 1 if the edge is gray (no coupling, J=0); 2 if the edge is green (ferromagnetic coupling, J=-1); and 3 if the edge is purple (antiferromagnetic coupling, J=+1)
* 'player1_id' and 'player2_id': strings, specifying the names of the agents
* 'turn_count': an integer, the number of turns that have been played to obtain the game state
* 'current_player_index': an integer, either 1 or 2, corresponding to whose turn it is 
* 'player1_node' and 'player2_node': integers, the vertices owned by the players; if none chosen yet, this is -1

Here's an example:

game_state = {'num_nodes': 6, 'edges': [(0, 1, 1), (0, 2, 1), (0, 3, 2), (0, 4, 3), (0, 5, 2), (1, 2, 1),
(1, 3, 2), (1, 4, 3), (1, 5, 3), (2, 3, 1), (2, 4, 2), (2, 5, 3), (3, 4, 2), (3, 5, 1), (4, 5, 2)],
'player1_id': 'player1', 'player2_id': 'player2', 'turn_count': 17, 'current_player_index': 1,
'player1_node': 1, 'player2_node': 3}

Certain aspects of the game state must agree with the game graph, including matching vertex count, and all edges
in the game board graph must have corresponding entries in the 'edges' list of tuples (edge_count must be the same
as len(game_state['edges'])). If you want to add a new game graph, it's easy to modify the game state dictionary
corresponding to it -- just make sure the 'num_nodes' is your vertex count and 'edges' includes an entry for each
edge in your graph.

## Adjudication Output

Adjudicators output a dictionary with the following keys:

* 'input_state': a copy of the input dictionary
* 'adjudicator': a string, one of 'simulated_annealing', 'quantum_annealing', 'schrodinger_equation'
* 'influence_vector': a vector of real numbers of length vertex_count (one real number per vertex in the game graph)
* 'state_adjudication_result': a string, one of 'red', 'blue', 'draw', 'not_terminal'
* 'score': if both players have chosen vertices, the difference in their influence scores as a real number, otherwise None
* 'parameters': a copy of the parameters dictionary
